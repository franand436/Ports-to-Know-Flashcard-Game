# Ports-to-Know-Flashcard-Game
Matching game made by Prof Manzano but coded into a very basic python game.
I had the idea of making flashcards to memorize some of the port numbers for 
CompTIA Security+ and then figured I would also practice a bit of python coding
while I was at it and well here is what I created. Thank you for checking it out.
It will ask what the port number for a protocol is, if the input is incorrect, it will
let you know with the following message "Incorrect! Please try again." and then ask
the question again until the correct port number is input. If the protocol uses more
than one port it should accept the ports in any order, meaning they do not have to 
start from smallest number and end with the largest number. It should give you 
credit for being correct even if the port numbers are out of order. 

(Ex. the answer does not have to be 1 2 3 for the game to give you credit for
the correct answer. It will accept 3 2 1, 1 3 2, 2 3 1 etc. as long as all port numbers are present)

This game was only made for practice. Enjoy!
